**Ansible role for setting up ISC DHCP Server for IPv4 networks.**

> This role does not manage your firewall.

IPv6 functionality is currently disabled by this role.
It will be extended, when needed.

## Preface

A different approach for managing the dhcp daemon is used across distributions.

**Archlinux**, **RedHat** and **Suse** use two `systemd` unit files,
one for IPv4 called `dhcpd.service` and one for IPv6 called `dhcpd6.service`.
Although **Suse** uses a shared daemon configuration file located at
`/etc/sysconfig/dhcpd`.

**Debian** on the other hand has a legacy `init.d` script called
`isc-dhcp-server` which manages both and can itself be triggered via
`systemctl <status|start|...> isc-dhcp-server`. In **Debian** you enable/disable
the services for the different IP protocols by commenting
in/out `INTERFACESv4/INTERFACESv6` variables
in the daemon configuration file `/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server` and
not via enabling/disabling two differnt services.

And **Alpine** says: do it yourself! :)
Only for dual stack configurations, to be fair.

The configuration is divided in `dhcpd.conf` for IPv4
and `dhcpd6.conf` for IPv6 on almost all distributions,
except in **Alpine**. Here you find only one `dhcpd.conf` by default.

This role uses `dhcpd.conf` only and currently does not touch the `dhcpd6` service.

To keep the abstraction level low, and because I do not want to develop an
ansible-role-specific dsl for dhcpd.conf, the configuration options are piped in `as-is`.

## Default settings

By default this role will only enable DHCPv4 and create empty subnet
declarations for all subnets obtained via `{{ dhcpd_interfaces }}` that do not
have a `{{ dhcpd_subnets }}` declaration.

Empty subnet declarations effectively mean "*don't serve this subnet*".

Subnets must be explicitly configured via `dhcpd_subnets` dict.
